                <p>‘Manage your collections’ is a tool that allows archives services to add, edit, delete and restore information about their own collections in The National Archives’ online catalogue, Discovery.</p>
                <p class="back"><a href="">Back to top</a></p>
                <hr>
                <h3 name="two">What is Discovery?</h3>

                <p>Discovery is The National Archives’ online catalogue: visitors can use it to search for information about archival records and identify records that may be relevant to their research. </p>

                <p>Discovery contains more than 32 million descriptions of records held by The National Archives and over 2,500 archives across the country.</p>

                <p>Archives services can use ‘Manage Your Collections’ to upload catalogue information about their own collections to Discovery. We make this information available to Discovery users worldwide.</p>

                <p class="back"><a href="">Back to top</a></p>
                <hr>
                <h3 name="three">What kind of information should be added to Discovery?</h3>

                <p>You can add catalogue data to Discovery in one of two different formats:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>EAD (Encoded Archival Description): upload data using this international standard for encoding finding aids </li>
                    <li>Excel: upload catalogue data in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="back"><a href="">Back to top</a></p>
                <hr>
                <h3 name="four">How will Discovery display your data?</h3>

                <p>Discovery will display this information about your collection:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>reference number</li>
                    <li>the title of the collection</li>
                    <li>descriptive text</li>
                    <li>the date range of the records in the collection</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="back"><a href="">Back to top</a></p>

                <h3 name="five">Add catalogue descriptions to Discovery</h3>

                <p>Go to the ‘Add a collection’ page where you will be able to upload new catalogue data to Discovery.</p>

                <p>Step 1: download a blank template.</p>

                <p>Choose between EAD and Excel format. Download a blank template and fill in your catalogue data. Do not delete or hide any columns or fields.</p>

                <p>(Please note: we use columns A and B of each template for our own administrative purposes.  These columns are hidden when you download a blank template: column C will be the first column in your template.)</p>

                <p>Save the completed template on your computer.</p>

                <p>Step 2: upload the completed template.</p>

                <p>Click on ‘Upload file’. Select the file you wish to upload by clicking on ‘Choose a file’ in the window that appears. Then click the ‘Upload’ button.</p>

                <h4>Format your data</h4>

                <p>You can use the following characters to signify formatting in your catalogue data. You have the option to use either keyboard characters or symbols.</p>

                <table class="table table-responsive striped width-three-quarters">
                    <thead>

                            <th>Keyboard (ASCII) character</th>
                            <th>Symbol</th>

                        </tr>
                    </thead>
                    <tbody>
                        <tr>
                            <td>new paragraph</td>
                            <td>&vert;</td>
                            <td>&#182;</td>

                        </tr>
                        <tr>
                            <td>insert line break</td>

                </table>

                <p>When using Excel, you can also type ALT-Enter to signify the beginning of a new paragraph.</p>

                <h4>Preview and approve your catalogue data</h4>

                <p>You will need to preview your catalogue data and approve the way it displays before it can be accepted for publication in Discovery.</p>

                <p>Once your data has been validated, you will see the ‘Preview and approve’ button. Click on this button to see the catalogue data that you have uploaded.</p>

                <p>On the Sample preview page, click on ‘Approve’ or ‘Reject’.</p>

                <p>Edit the parts of the collection that you wish to change.  Do not hide or delete any columns.  If there are columns or fields in the template that are not relevant to your cataloguing schema, leave them empty. </p>

                <p>(Please note that we use columns A and B of the template for our own administrative purposes.  These columns will be hidden when you download your collection information.  However, if you are able to see details in columns headed ‘IAID’ and ‘PIAID’, do not edit this information. Making changes in these columns will make it impossible for Discovery to validate your catalogue data.)</p>

                <p>Once you have made the necessary changes, save the document to your computer.</p>

                <p>Within the ‘Edit a collection’ screen, click the ‘Upload changes’ button.</p>

                <h3 name="nine">Troubleshooting</h3>

                <h4>Validating your catalogue data</h4>

                <p>Go to the ‘View history’ page to see the status of your data upload.</p>

                <p>Please note that it will take between several minutes and a few hours to validate your catalogue data, depending on how much you have uploadedlarge your collection is. You will need to periodically refresh this page (click on your web browser’s refresh button or press the F5 key) to see changes in the status of your upload.</p>

                <h4>Upload failed</h4>

                <p>If your catalogue data upload fails, you will see the ‘See error report’ button on the View History page. Click on this for the Validation report, which shows the reason(s) why your data cannot be published in Discovery.</p>

                <p>‘Error’ alerts must be resolved before your catalogue data can be uploaded to Discovery.</p>

                <p>‘Warning’ alerts indicate potential issues that can be resolved to improve the quality of your data as it is displayed in Discovery.</p>

                <p>Each alert indicates the row number where the issue occurs, the column name and details of the problem identified.</p>

                <p>Resolve the errors in the template. Once you have fixed all the errors, repeat the catalogue data upload process.</p>


                <h4>Data format</h4>

                <p>Your catalogue data must be submitted in the correct format for the upload to succeed.  Please download one of our templates – either in EAD or Excel format – and fill in your catalogue data.</p>

                <p>Upload this completed template to add information to Discovery, or to edit information already held in it.</p>

                <p>Do do not delete or hide any columns or fields included in the template. If there are columns or fields in the template that are not relevant to your cataloguing schema, leave them empty.</p>

                <p>We use columns A and B of each template for our own administrative purposes, populating them with unique system identifiers. These columns are hidden when you download a blank template.</p>

                <p>If you are able to see details in columns headed ‘IAID’ and ‘PIAID’, do not edit this information. Making changes in these columns will make it impossible for Discovery to validate your catalogue data.</p>

                <h4>AutoCorrect in Excel</h4>

                <p>Excel's AutoCorrect function may affect some the data that you add to a template.  For example, the AutoCorrect function may automatically alter the surname 'Alway', changing it to 'Always'.</p>

                <p>In Excel, full auto-correction is set as default.</p>

                <p>You may need to disable some of the auto-correction options on any Excel templates that you use for cataloguing projects.</p>

                <p>To do this:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Open the spreadsheet you are working on, or the Excel template you intend to distribute to others for cataloguing</li>
                    <li>Click on the ‘File’ menu</li>
                    <li>Select ‘Options’ from the drop-down menu.</li>
                    <li>Click on ‘Proofing’ in the menu on the left side of the dialog box</li>
                    <li>Click the ‘AutoCorrect Options…’ button</li>
                    <li>When the AutoCorrect window appears, uncheck ‘Replace text as you type’ </li>
                    <li>You may also wish to disable 'Correct TWo INitial CApitals', and other options where cataloguing data may include character sequences which Excel does not recognise as correct</li>
                    <li>Click on ‘OK’</li>
